Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell PID & PPID A process is an instance of an executing program, that has a unique process ID. This process ID is used by many functions and system calls to interact with and manipulate processes. In order to retrieve the current process’ ID, you can use the system call getpid (man 2 getpid)

Exercises 0. getppid Write a program that prints the PID of the parent process. Run your program several times within the same shell. It should be the same. Does echo $$ print the same value? Why?

/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max Write a shell script that prints the maximum value a process ID can be.
Arguments The command line arguments are passed through the main function: int main(int ac, char **av);

av is a NULL terminated array of strings ac is the number of items in av av[0] usually contains the name used to invoke the current program. av[1] is the first argument of the program, av[2] the second, and so on.

Exercises 0. av Write a program that prints all the arguments, without using ac.

Read line Write a program that prints "$ ", wait for the user to enter a command, prints it on the next line.
man 3 getline

important make sure you read the man, and the RETURN VALUE section, in order to know when to stop reading Keyword: “end-of-file”, or EOF (or Ctrl+D).

#advanced: Write your own version of getline.

command line to av Write a function that splits a string and returns an array of each word of the string.
man strtok

#advanced: Write the function without strtok

Executing a program The system call execve allows a process to execute another program (man 2 execve). Note that this system call does load the new program into the current process’ memory in place of the “previous” program: on success execve does not return to continue the rest of the “previous” program.

Warning: in this example, execve is used without the current environment (last argument), don’t forget to add it in your Shell!

Creating processes The system call fork (man 2 fork) creates a new child process, almost identical to the parent (the process that calls fork). Once fork successfully returns, two processes continue to run the same program, but with different stacks, datas and heaps.

Wait The wait system call (man 2 wait) suspends execution of the calling process until one of its children terminates.

Exercise: fork + wait + execve Write a program that executes the command ls -l /tmp in 5 different child processes. Each child should be created by the same process (the father). Wait for a child to exit before creating a new child.

Exercise: super simple shell Using everything we saw, write a first version of a super simple shell that can run commands with their full path, without any argument.

File information The stat (man 2 stat) system call gets the status of a file. On success, zero is returned. On error, -1 is returned.

Exercise: find a file in the PATH Write a program that looks for files in the current PATH.

Usage: _which filename ...

Environment We have seen earlier that the shell uses an environment list, where environment variables are “stored”. The list is an array of strings, with the following format: var=value, where var is the name of the variable and value its value. As a reminder, you can list the environment with the command printenv

Actually, every process comes with an environment. When a new process is created, it inherits a copy of its parent’s environment. To access the entire environment within a process, you have several options:

via the main function via the global variable environ (man environ) main So far we have seen that main could have different prototypes:

int main(void); int main(int ac, char **av); There is actually another prototype:

int main(int ac, char **av, char **env); where env is a NULL terminated array of strings.

Exercises 0. printenv with environ Write a program that prints the environment using the global variable environ.

env vs environ Write a program that prints the address of env (the third parameter of the main function) and environ (the global variable). Are they they same? Does this make sense?

getenv() Write a function that gets an environment variable. (without using getenv)

Prototype: char *_getenv(const char *name); man 3 getenv

PATH Write a function that prints each directory contained in the the environment variable PATH, one directory per line.

PATH Write a function that builds a linked list of the PATH directories.

setenv Write a function that changes or adds an environment variable (without using setenv).

Prototype: int _setenv(const char *name, const char *value, int overwrite); man 3 setenv

unsetenv Write a function that deletes the variable name from the environment (without using unsetenv).
Prototype: int _unsetenv(const char *name); man 3 unsetenv
